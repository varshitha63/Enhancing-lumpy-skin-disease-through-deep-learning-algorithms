The project focuses on detecting lumpy skin disease in cattle using deep learning algorithms. Lumpy skin disease is a condition that affects cattle, causing symptoms like fever, infertility, and reduced milk production. The system uses advanced machine learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to analyze images of cattle and identify signs of the disease. By automating the detection process, it helps farmers and veterinarians quickly diagnose the illness, enabling timely treatment and reducing its spread. This solution improves animal health management, minimizes losses, and supports the agricultural industry by leveraging the power of deep learning technology.
